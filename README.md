# Java-AnimalRescue

I developed this program in my intro to Java Applicatios course at SNHU. The goal of this program is to display and add items to lists of rescue animals(dogs and monkeys) for a fictional animal reascue orginaztion. If the option to add an animal is chosen, the program will ask a series of questions that will then fill in the attributes for the animal in question then append the animal to the list. There is also an option available to reserve both animal types as well as a function to print out a list of the animals that are available to be reserved.
